For 0.9
--------

  - Tidy up feature source creation [DONE]
  - Overlay sources [DONE, at least for the merge-by-coords case]
  - Scatter-plot views [DONE]
  - Track-hub support [Basics done, now lots more options to support...]
  - Tracks via Ensembl-REST [DONE]
  - Tracks via JBrowse-JSON [DONE]
  - Abbreviations when typing locations. [DONE]
  - Thresholding/leaping on quantitative tracks [DONE]
  - SVG export parity [DONE: Label placement, better grouping, quant-scales]
  - Configurability of ruler [DONE]
  - Sort out feature popups for composite features [DONE]
  - Feature popup extensibility [DONE]
  - Help popup [DONE]
  - Better way of packaging CSS etc.?  (can we lose uiPrefix?) [CORS on the css/ and img/ directories seems to fix most of the issues here]
  - Reinstate MAX_VEW_SIZE in some configurable manner. [DONE Browser.maxViewWidth]
 
For 0.10
--------
   
  - UI for next/prev
  - Animate when leaping.
    + Also snap-zooming?
    + Inform user of progress
  - Better zoom control
  - Small BED/WIG support
  - Tabix support (VCF/GFF/GTF)  [DONE on dart_backends branch]
  - Chromosome overviews
  - Incremental data fetching
  - Try to preserve layout when expanding/collapsing variants.
  - Better search (using TRIX?)
  - Stylesheet editor.
  - Out-to-chromosome zooming
    + Probably needs a better set of semantic zoom hints in the
      stylesheet language.  
  - Bulk addition of local files.
  - Assembly hub support.
  - Track hub composite tracks.
  - User interface for connecting to a track hub.
  - Replace feature popups with inspector?
     + Maybe a more general popupocalypse? (track-adder, help, etc.?)

For 0.11
--------

  - Undo/redo.  
  - History of recently-viewed tracks.
  - RDF/FALDO support?


Future
-------------

 - Work out the kinks in security/preflighting.
 - Construct as a web-component
   + (web component polyfills aren't quite ready yet).
 - Better tiling in renderer.
 - Better control of vertical resize.
 - Better configuration of quantitative tracks.
     + Global y-zoom? [Matias wants this.  Wouldn't per-trackgroup be better?  Needs an explicit idea of track-groups.]
     + Switch between bars/colourways? [Leave this for now]
     + Increase/decrease viewed height of quant tracks?
 - Non-positional annotation.
 - Alignment improvements.
 - Consider JSON-DAS -- is this alive???

Nice to have
------------

 - Gene search:
     + Would be nice if it offered proper keyword search, rather than pure feature-but-ID
     + Any reason not to just hack the server to do this?
     + Suggest-as-you-type?
     + Does new DAS search proposal help?
 - State persistance between sessions
     + Add a "make URL" button?
 - Tier groups
     + Should yZoom together.
     + Other quantitative stuff?  If we support colourway switching then probably.
     + Do they have any meaning for non-quant tracks?
     + Drag together when re-ordering????
     + How are these defined?  DASSTYLE is hopeless.  Extended SOURCES document?
 - Dedicated configuration/persistance language?
 - Distance between a pair of features.
 - Rename tiers?
 - Multiple configurations/session switching/etc?

Blue sky
--------
    
 - Real-time collaborative features
    + i.e. multiple users viewing a browser with shared state.
    + Annotation (Using DAS writeback protocols?)
    + View synchronization?
    + Chat 
    + Websockets work nicely for this.  Prototype at DAS Workshop '10.
 - Navigate by blatting user sequences to the genome
    + How to do this in a DASish world?
    + Relationship with tourist mode?
 - MultiContigView equivalent?

The Server Side
---------------
 
 - Tidy up the Allow-Credentials support in Dazzle.
 - Dazzle replacement (i.e. fast, scalable, DAS middleware).
    + Any ideas from Cadastral worth following up?
    + If I write a new one, would I still do it in Java?
        * BioJava 1.4?  "BioJava 3"?  New API?
    + Alternatively... do a "Dazzle 1.5" major update
        * possible to keep the decent bits while re-doing the plugin API?
 - DAS3? :-)
