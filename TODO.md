Future
-------------

 - Construct as a web-component
   + (web component polyfills aren't quite ready yet).
 - Better tiling in renderer.
 - Non-positional annotation.
 - Alignment improvements.

Nice to have
------------

 - State persistance between sessions
     + Add a "make URL" button?
 - Tier groups
     + Should yZoom together.
     + Other quantitative stuff?  If we support colourway switching then probably.
     + Do they have any meaning for non-quant tracks?
     + Drag together when re-ordering????
     + How are these defined?  DASSTYLE is hopeless.  Extended SOURCES document?
 - Dedicated configuration/persistance language?
 - Distance between a pair of features.
 - Multiple configurations/session switching/etc?

Blue sky
--------
    
 - MultiContigView equivalent?
 - Client-side analysis of quantitative tracks.
