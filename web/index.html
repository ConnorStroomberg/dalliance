Dalliance is an interactive genome viewer which runs directly in your web browser.  Try it here:

<ul> 
  <li><a href="/human/ncbi36/">Human NCBI36</a></li> 
  <li><a href="/human/GRCh37/">Human GRCh37</a> (includes demo of assembly-mapping system)</li> 
  <li><a href="/mouse/ncbi_m37/">Mouse NCBIm37</a> (currently limited amounts of data, human version is recommended)</li> 
</ul> 
 
The aim is for a high level of interactivity.  Drag to scroll ("Google Maps" style), or try a panning
gesture if your input device supports this.
 
<p> Dalliance requires a modern web browser with good support for
Scalable Vector Graphics.  <a
 href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox</a> 3.6+, <a
 href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a>, and <a
 href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a> 5 are all tested
regularly and seem to work nicely.  Internet Explorer won't work at
all, although we're optimistic that we'll be able to support IE9 (but
not earlier versions) in the future.

<p>Dalliance also doesn't currently support touch based hardware such
as the iphone, ipod and ipad.  We've looked at adding support but
currently there are serious browser performance issues with the webkit
which make scrolling ineffective.

Developers might want to take a look at the Github page <a href="http://github.com/dasmoth/dalliance">here</a>.  Right now, that's
probably also the best source of documentation...
